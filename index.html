<a id="faq---frequently-asked-questions" class="anchor" href="#faq---frequently-asked-questions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions​</h3>

<p><strong>Who are you?​</strong>
We are a nice party with bunch of adventurers from origin of Mount&amp;Blade series, Turkey. And of course we accept new ones from other factions.​</p>

<p><strong>Crusader Kings II with Mount&amp;Blade? Why?​</strong>
Because political and feudal structure is really fits perfect to Crusader Kings II. When I playing Mount&amp;Blade, I really want to play as a map based strategy game. And of course, I want Bannerlord too. I mean... who doesn't :D?​</p>

<p><strong>Is there a release date yet?​</strong>
No, not really. Actually we really want to release an open beta, or an early staged alpha. We completed tons of things and yet there is a lot of work to do.​</p>
